A Super Challenging Coding Quiz

This application uses solid javascript based logic to move through a quiz game about Javascript.  It adds time when you are correct and deducts time when you are wrong.  If you lose by running out of time or fail to answer a question correctly, the high score form is hidden from the page.  Buttons and redirects take you from start screen to quiz screen to end game screen with or without a form.

The game starts with this welcome screen

If you have a score the end screen has a high score form

if you got all the questions wrong or run out of time, you get the "you lose" screen without form

When you click submit from the form or the view high scores page, this high score list appears.
