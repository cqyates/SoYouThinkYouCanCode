# SoYouThinkYouCanCode
A Super Challenging Coding Quiz

This application uses solid javascript based logic to move through a quiz game about Javascript.  It adds time when you are correct and deducts time when you are wrong.  If you lose by running out of time or fail to answer a question correctly, the high score form is hidden from the page.  Buttons and redirects take you from start screen to quiz screen to end game screen with or without a form.
